# Best Practices for Sharing and Publishing CZNet Data

The CZ Hub Team is developing a Data Submission Portal to meet the needs of the CZ Collaborative Network (CZNet). The Data Submission Portal provides guidance regarding which data repositories into which products should be deposited and also provides functionality that allows submission of data to the appropriate repository through the Portal. Once the Portal is operational, we recommend that all data and research products be submitted to the appropriate repository through the Portal. We provide the following additional guidance for submitting data for sharing and publication.

## Which Repository Should I Use?

Our initial focus in developing the CZ Hub Data Submission Portal and for this data publication guidance is on the repositories listed below. We anticipate adding support for additional repositories via the Data Submission Portal as resources allow us to add them. If the supported repositories listed below will not meet your needs, choose a trusted repository that follows international best practices by offering:

1. A public landing page for your dataset/product.
2. A unique identifier/digital object identifier (DOI) and URL for accessing the landing page for your dataset/product.
3. A formal citation for your dataset/product.

You can find directories of data repositories at [https://www.re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org) and [https://fairsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org).

We provide the general guidance with regard to supported repositories below, but we are happy to discuss any questions you may have and make more specific recommendations:

1. [HydroShare](http://www.hydroshare.org): A general purpose repository for submitting water-science related datasets and models. Submit datasets, models, and other research products that are water-related. This includes time series of hydrologic observations, time series of data from weather stations, geospatial datasets, etc. HydroShare is flexible and allows upload of files having any format. HydroShare also includes a linked JupyterHub server if you wish to upload executable Jupyter Notebooks using Python or R with your content. For information about how to submit to HydroShare, you can access HydroShare’s help system at [https://help.hydroshare.org](https://help.hydroshare.org).
2. [EarthChem](http://www.earthchem.org): A repository for submitting data derived from material samples such as soil, sediment, pore water, or rock specimens; cores; and other physical objects. Primary focus is on geochemical, geochronological, petrological, and mineralogical data. EarthChem strongly recommends use of data submission templates available on the EarthChem web site ([https://earthchem.org/ecl/templates/](https://earthchem.org/ecl/templates/)) that provide guidance for properly documenting data quality and provenance. Though data can be contributed to the EarthChem Library in a wide range of formats ([https://ecl.earthchem.org/fileformat.php](https://ecl.earthchem.org/fileformat.php)), it always needs to be documented with relevant information regarding the analytical data quality. Submission guidelines for EarthChem can be accessed at [https://www.earthchem.org/ecl/submission-guidelines/](https://www.earthchem.org/ecl/submission-guidelines/). For help, go to [https://earthchem.org/resources/support/earthchem-library-documentation/](https://earthchem.org/resources/support/earthchem-library-documentation/) or write to [info@earthchem.org](mailto:info@earthchem.org).
3. [Zenodo](http://www.zenodo.org): A catch-all repository that may be an appropriate place to upload content that is not appropriate for the other repositories. Zenodo does not limit what you can upload and is not domain specific. For more information about Zenodo and submitting data, see [https://zenodo.org/record/787445](https://zenodo.org/record/787445).
4. [SESAR](https://www.geosamples.org): A sample registry that catalogs sample metadata, sample images, and other information to make samples more discoverable, accessible, and reusable. SESAR allows you to get an IGSN for your samples, a globally unique identifier that is essential for unambiguously citing samples in datasets and publications ([https://www.igsn.org](https://www.igsn.org)). Use SESAR to submit metadata about your samples and obtain IGSN Global Sample Numbers. Resources for researchers can be accessed at [https://www.geosamples.org/resources/researchers](https://www.geosamples.org/resources/researchers), and tutorials and FAQs can be accessed at [https://www.geosamples.org/resources/help](https://www.geosamples.org/resources/help).
5. [OpenTopography](https://opentopography.org): A repository that facilitates community access to high-resolution, Earth science-oriented, topography data and related tools and resources. Submit high resolution topography data acquired with lidar and other technologies. A tutorial describing how to submit data to OpenTopography can be accessed at: [https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/docs/CommunityDataspaceTutorial.pdf](https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/docs/CommunityDataspaceTutorial.pdf).

If you choose to submit your data or research products to a repository other than the ones listed above, we will still need to know about those submissions. Please register these datasets with the CZ Net Data Submission Portal.

Please see our specific guidance for CZNet data and research products below for information on what to do if you submit to a different repository.

## General Guidance for all CZNet Data and Research Products to be Submitted

We offer the following general guidelines for submitting your data and other research products. For a full overview, [click here](https://criticalzone.org/uploads/publications/Data-Products-Guide-CZhub.pdf).

1. **Use the Best Practices and Templates Described in this Repository**: Please follow the specific best practices, data formats, and templates described in this repository.
2. **Start assembling your data now**: We recommend that you begin thinking about which products (e.g., data, images, samples, code) you will generate. Assemble and document them as early as possible after generating them (it will save you time later), and register them within one of the above repositories. You need not wait until your data are ready for formal publication. HydroShare, EarthChem, and Zenodo all offer the ability to upload private content, allowing you to capture and store your data safely while your research and publication process is ongoing. Then share and publish when you are ready. Register your samples online in SESAR.
3. **Tag your data with appropriate metadata**: Use the repository’s submission form and templates to enter descriptive metadata for your products. Metadata should include information needed to discover and cite your products, but also additional information required to interpret your content (e.g., procedures used to collect or analyze samples or observations).
4. **Use common, open, and accepted data formats**: We know that the data you are creating are diverse and that there is not always specific guidance for how to organize your data and which file formats to use. We have provided some links to general data management resources in the section at the end of this document. If you have questions about what to do, please contact us.
5. **Include a “readme” file**: A readme file can include detailed information about the structure or content of your data or research product. It can also be used to describe how to perform specific analyses to make your research results more reproducible. If you upload a “readme.txt” or “readme.md” file to your resource in HydroShare, it will be displayed on the landing page for your resource.

We have included links to additional documentation that may assist you in preparing your datasets and research products for sharing and publication. We are always happy to discuss specific questions you may have.

## Specific Guidance for CZNet Data and Research Products

The CZ Hub Team will be working to provide a coordinated view of all CZNet data/research products submitted to reputable data repositories via cataloging and data discovery functionality. We will be using some specific information to find and catalog resources submitted to the different repositories (see below). If the information we request below is missing, we may not be able to find your submitted resource and include it in the CZNet metadata index and discovery tools.

**NOTE**: When complete, the CZNet Data Submission Portal will guide you to provide the following information to be entered for all datasets and products submitted through the Portal. However, we know that some may choose to submit directly to a repository without using the Data Submission Portal, so it is important to specify this information regardless of how or when you submit your data.

To accomplish this, we ask that you do the following, regardless of which repository you deposit your data in:

1. Tag your dataset/product with the subject keyword “CZNet”.
2. Tag your dataset/product with a subject keyword that is unique to your Thematic Cluster project. Use this keyword consistently for all products you share.
3. Ensure that you enter funding information, including funding agency (National Science Foundation), award number, and, if possible given the metadata elements available, award title.
4. Make sure that your dataset is publicly available. HydroShare, EarthChem, and Zenodo enable private content. We may not be able to discover and catalog your datasets/products until you have made them publicly available.

### Guidance for HydroShare, EarthChem, and Zenodo

We will be using “community” and “group” functionality within the different repositories to help group and present data from the cluster projects. When you submit to HydroShare, EarthChem, or Zenodo, we ask that you associate your dataset/product with an appropriate Group or Community, depending on which repository you submit to:

* **HydroShare** - share your dataset/product with your Cluster’s HydroShare Group. We have created a HydroShare “Group” for each thematic cluster project. You can share your HydroShare resource with your Group by clicking on the “Manage Access” button on the resource’s landing page and giving view or edit access to your cluster’s group. This can be done at any time after you create your resource in HydroShare.
* **EarthChem** - associate your dataset/product with the “Critical Zone” community within EarthChem. See [https://earthchem.org/communities/cznet/](https://earthchem.org/communities/cznet/)
* **Zenodo** - associate your dataset/product with the “Critical Zone Data and Research Products” community ([https://www.zenodo.org/communities/czdata/](https://www.zenodo.org/communities/czdata/)). When you create a new upload, search for “czdata” or “Critical Zone Data and Research Products” to find the correct community.

### Guidance for Data/Products Submitted to Other Repositories

We know that our list of supported repositories may not meet the needs of all of the CZNet cluster projects for all of the different types of data products. If you choose to submit your data/product(s) to a repository other than the ones in our list of supported repositories, we will be unable to discover and catalog those products unless you tell us about them. Please make sure that you register these data products with the CZNet Data Submission Portal. 

## Linking Datasets with Publications

We strongly recommend creating formal linkages between the datasets you have deposited within the above mentioned repositories and any manuscripts that you submit for publication that use or are based on the data. This ensures that anyone who discovers the paper can link to and access the data used and anyone who discovers the data can link to and access publications that have used the data.

After depositing your datasets within one of the above repositories we recommend formally citing the data within any research manuscripts based on the data that you submit for publication. Recommendations in the Author Guide for the journal to which you submit may determine how datasets are cited in the text of the paper. In the absence of specific instructions from the journal, we recommend citing data within the text of the paper using the journal’s citation style (e.g., Author(s), Year) and including a full bibliographic citation to the dataset within the references section of the paper.

Once a paper has been accepted for publication and a digital object identifier (DOI) or citation has been issued for the paper, you should modify the metadata for the dataset in the repository to include a link to the paper as a “related resource.”
